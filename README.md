Step 1: Project Initialization and Setup

Goal: Initialize a new Node.js project and install necessary packages.

Steps:
1. Initialize the project:
   mkdir json-rest-api
   cd json-rest-api
   npm init -y
   
   - Why: This creates a `package.json` file to manage dependencies and project metadata.

2. Install necessary packages:
   
   npm install express body-parser ajv ajv-formats uuid dotenv
   
   - Packages and their significance:
     - `express`: A web framework for Node.js to create the server and define routes.
     - `body-parser`: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property.
     - `ajv`: A JSON Schema validator.
     - `ajv-formats`: Adds format validation for strings (like "email").
     - `uuid`: Generates unique IDs.
     - `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

Step 2: Define the JSON Schema

Goal: Create a JSON schema to validate incoming data.

Steps:
1. Create a directory and a schema file:
   mkdir schemas
   touch schemas/resourceSchema.json
   
2. Define the schema:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "object",
     "properties": {
       "id": {
         "type": "string"
       },
       "name": {
         "type": "string"
       },
       "email": {
         "type": "string",
         "format": "email"
       },
       "age": {
         "type": "integer",
         "minimum": 0
       }
     },
     "required": ["id", "name", "email"]
   }
   ```
   - Why: This schema defines the structure and data types of the resource, ensuring data integrity.

Step 3: Create the Controller

Goal: Separate business logic from routing.

Steps:
1. Create a directory and a controller file:
   ```bash
   mkdir controllers
   touch controllers/resourceController.js
   ```
2. Implement the controller logic:
   
   - Why: Separating the controller logic improves code maintainability and readability.

Step 4: Define the Routes

Goal: Define API endpoints and link them to the controller.

Steps:
1. Create a directory and a routes file:
   ```bash
   mkdir routes
   touch routes/resourceRoutes.js
   ```
2. Implement the routes:
   
   - Why: This organizes route definitions and associates them with their respective controller functions.

Step 5: Set Up the Server

Goal: Initialize and configure the Express server to use the routes and middleware.

Steps:
1. Create a server file:
   ```bash
   touch server.js
   ```
2. Implement the server:
   ```javascript
   ```
   - Why: This sets up the server, middleware, and routes, making the application functional.

Step 6: Create and Configure .env File

Goal: Use environment variables to configure the application.

Steps:
1. Create a .env file:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
2. Define environment variables:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   ```
   - Why: This allows configuration settings to be managed separately from the code, improving security and flexibility.

Step 7: Run and Test the Server

Goal: Start the server and test the API endpoints.

Steps:
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. Test the API using curl or Postman:

   - Create a Resource (POST /api/v1/resource)
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/resource -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
       "name": "John Doe",
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "age": 30
     }'
     ```

   - Get a Resource (GET /api/v1/resource/:id)
     ```bash
     curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/resource/{id}
     ```

   - Conditional Read (GET /api/v1/resource/:id with If-None-Match)
     ```bash
     curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/resource/{id} -H "If-None-Match: {etag}"
     ```

   - Delete a Resource (DELETE /api/v1/resource/:id)
     ```bash
     curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/v1/resource/{id}
     ```

   - Using Postman:
     - Import the provided JSON collection into Postman.
     - Use the endpoints to test the API.

Significance and How It Works

1. Separation of Concerns:
   - **Controllers:** Handle the business logic and interact with the data.
   - **Routes:** Define API endpoints and delegate to controllers.
   - **Server:** Configures and runs the Express application.

2. Validation:
   - **AJV and JSON Schema:** Ensures incoming data adheres to the defined schema, preventing invalid data from being processed.

3. Conditional Requests:
   - **ETag and If-None-Match:** Allows clients to make efficient conditional requests, reducing unnecessary data transfer.

4. Environment Variables:
   - **dotenv:** Manages configuration settings outside the source code, enhancing security and flexibility.

5. Testing:
   - **Postman and curl:** Facilitates testing and debugging of API endpoints.
